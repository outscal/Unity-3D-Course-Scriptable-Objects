## **Scriptable Objects?**

Scriptable objects In this lesson I am going to teach you the concept of a "scriptable" object. and how to use it in our project. Those objects are like "assets", just like images or music. The difference is that you import these into our project and the "scriptable" objects you create yourself through code. I'm going to show you how to use them and the possibilities they offer us. Before continuing, I want to tell you that it is a complex concept. Even me, who works on this, I had a hard time understanding it. You have the possibility to repeat the lesson as much as you want.
