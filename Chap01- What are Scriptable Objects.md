A ScriptableObject is a data container that you can use to save large amounts of data, independent of class instances. One of the main use cases for ScriptableObjects is to reduce your Projectâ€™s memory usage by avoiding copies of values. This is useful if your Project has a prefab that stores unchanging data in attached MonoBehaviour scripts.
